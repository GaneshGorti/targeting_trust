<h2>Phase 4: Decision task</h2>

<p>
You will now receive a pool of income and will decide how much to send to the Administrator.
</p>

<hr>

<p>
Your available amount is your <strong>net income (after tax)</strong>: <strong>{{ trust_budget }} ECU</strong>.
</p>

<h3>How it works</h3>
<ul>
  <li>You may send any amount from 0 to {{ trust_budget }} ECU.</li>
  <li>For every ECU you send, the Administrator receives {{ mult }} ECU.</li>
  <li>The Administrator will then decide how much to return to you.</li>
</ul>
